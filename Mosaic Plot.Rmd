# Introduction
CBEP recently received a grant from NSF's CIVIC Innovation Challenge to work on 
developing hydrodynamic models that address community needs in Portland Harbor.
As part of the project, CBEP hosted three community workshops in November of
2022.

Facilitators produced both "live" notes during the meeting -- visible to all on
a screen at the front of the meeting room -- and detailed meeting transcripts.
CBEP staff then reviewed those notes paragraph by paragraph, and coded each 
paragraph in terms of six characteristics:

*  Potential users and uses of hydrodynamic models,

*  Data or information needs identified by community members,

*  Implied extensions of the initial Casco Bay Model required to fully address
   those data needs, and
   
*  Ideas for improving communications of model results (e.g., communications 
   channels and user interface design),

*  Specifications for model performance or data criteria such as resolution,
   geographic coverage or ability to conduct simulations.

*  Suggestions about monitoring or data collection that could improve
   information availability.

If a paragraph or live note included something relevant to one or more of
these categories, we summarized the related idea, and then assigned each
paragraph or comment to categories. In this way we can look at what ideas were 
expressed most commonly during the workshops.

Of course, not all paragraphs include information related to each of the six 
types of information, so there is not a perfect one-to-one correspondence 
between categories.

In this R Notebook, I generate a few mosaic plots.  I isolate this code
here because the mosaic plots were crashing rendering of PDF documents.

# Load Packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggmosaic)
library(readxl)
library(networkD3)

theme_set(theme_classic())
```

# Create Figures Folder
```{r}
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```


# Load Data
```{r}
the_data <- read_excel("Data_Export_Query.xlsx" ) %>%
  mutate(ID = as.integer(ID)) %>%
  rename_with(function(x) sub(" Category_Category", '_Category', x)) %>%
  rename_with(function(x) sub(" ", '_', x))
head(the_data)
```

Our coding was generated in a somewhat sloppy `Access` database, and because of
the way SQL works, it is easier to replace numerical values for some groups
here, in `R`, rather than before we exported the data from `Access`. I read in
the dictionaries here.

```{r}
timing_table <- read_excel("Timing Category.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text"))
data_types_table <- read_excel("Data Type.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text"))
```

##  Numerical Values to Strings
And finally I correct the data table to all text entries.
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(Data_Timing = timing_table$Timing[match(Data_Timing, 
                                                 timing_table$ID)],
         Extension_Timing = timing_table$Timing[match(Extension_Timing,
                                                      timing_table$ID)],
         Performance_Timing = timing_table$Timing[match(Performance_Timing,
                                                      timing_table$ID)]) %>%
  mutate(Monitoring_Data_Group = data_types_table$Group[match(Monitoring_Data_Group,
                                                    data_types_table$ID)],
         Performance_Type = data_types_table$Group[match(Performance_Type,
                                                    data_types_table$ID)])
```


#A Warning about Uniqueness
We have to be careful here, because each note or comment can be represented in 
this data table multiple times. Each paragraph in the meeting transcript might 
imply several different users, for example.  But if there are multiple users and
multiple data types, the records got duplicated (in part) in the SQL query.  So 
for any analysis, we need to test for uniqueness of the data. always

We actually have over 375 records, built out of just over 200 unique comments.

```{r}
cat("All rows in the data:\t\t")
nrow(the_data)

cat("Unique comments reviewed:\t")
the_data %>%
  select(ID) %>%
  unique() %>%
  nrow()
```

# Model Performance
```{r}
tmp <- the_data %>%
  select(ID, Performance_Category, Performance_Type, Performance_Timing) %>%
  unique() %>%
  filter(if_any(starts_with('Performance_'), ~!is.na(.))) %>%
  filter(! is.na(Performance_Category),
           Performance_Category != "Timing" )  %>%
  mutate(Performance_Category = fct_infreq(Performance_Category),
         Performance_Type = fct_infreq(Performance_Type),
         Performance_Timing = fct_infreq(Performance_Timing))
```

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(tmp, aes(Performance_Category)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Performance_Type)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 14,
                                   hjust = 1, vjust = 0.25)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = 'Data Type') +
  ylab('Count') +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Performance Suggestions")

```

## Testing Mosaic Plots
The `ggmosaic' package allows mosaic plots, but it's a but buggy and hard to
use.  Note that if I plot the mosaic plot directly, it crashes rendering of the
PDF document.  The workaround here simply saves a graphic and then displays it.

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
the_mosaic <- ggplot(tmp) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(Performance_Category), 
                  fill = Performance_Type)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = 'Data Type') +
  ggtitle("Model Performance") +
  theme_mosaic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 12, 
                                   hjust = 1, vjust = 0.25),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12)) +
  xlab('') +
  ylab('')

the_mosaic
```

```{r}
ggsave('figures/Performance_Mosaic.png', the_mosaic, type='cairo',
         width = 6, height = 5)
```


On the whole, what we see is that people commented repeatedly on the need for
high spatial resolution information, especially with regards to water level,
inundation, and waves. Many comments also good temporal resolution for water 
level data - -often associates with forecasting tidal datums for habitat 
restoration.  Finally, numerous comments focused on geographic extent and 
model availability, but those comments were usually generic, and not tied to
specific data needs or requests.

It is possible to layer a third variable into these Mosaic Plots, or to use 
`ggplot` faceting functions to look at three way contingency tables, but
in this setting, it's just confusing.  We have too many possible divisions of
the three variables associated with each performance comment.

#Users and Data Types
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
reduced_data <- the_data %>%
  select(ID, User_Category, Data_Group) %>%
  unique() %>%
  filter(! is.na(User_Category), 
         ! is.na(Data_Group)#,
         #User_Category != "Other",      # Dropped because none have timing
         #Data_Timing != 'Unclear'       # Dropped because uninformative.    
         ) %>%  
  mutate(User_Category = fct_infreq(User_Category),
         Data_Timing = fct_infreq(Data_Group))
   
  ggplot(reduced_data, aes(User_Category)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Data_Group)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 14,
                                   hjust = 1, vjust = 0.25)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = '') +
  ylab('Count') +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Data")

```

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 7}
the_mosaic <- ggplot(reduced_data) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(User_Category), 
                  fill = Data_Group)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = '') +
  ggtitle("User Information Needs") +
  theme_mosaic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 10, 
                                   hjust = 1, vjust = 0.25),
          axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = 'top') +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(nrow=3)) +
  xlab('User Category') +
  ylab('')

```{r}
ggsave('figures/User_Needs_Mosaic.png', the_mosaic, type='cairo',

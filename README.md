# Harbor_Model_Users
Graphic analysis of community workshops with potential users of high-resolution coastal models for Portland Harbor

# Introduction
CBEP is working with NERACOOS and UMASS Dartmouth to develop a high-resolution
coastal model of the Casco Bay Region.  The original motivation for the model
was to address water quality concerns regarding discharges from wastewater
treatment facilities that discharge to Casco Bay.  However, value of a
hydrodynamic model could potentially extend well beyond addressing water quality
concerns.

CBEP recently received a grant from NSF's CIVIC Innovation Challenge to work on 
developing hydrodynamic models that address community needs in Portland Harbor.
As part of the project, CBEP hosted three community workshops in November of
2022.

Facilitators produced both "live" notes during the meeting -- visible to all on
a screen at the front of the meeting room -- and detailed meeting transcripts.
CBEP staff then reviewed those notes paragraph by paragraph, and coded each 
paragraph in terms of six characteristics:

*  Potential users and uses of hydrodynamic models,

*  Data or information needs identified by community members,

*  Ideas for improving communications of model results (e.g., communications 
   channels and user interface design),

*  Specifications for model performance or data criteria such as resolution,
   geographic coverage or ability to conduct simulations.

*  Extensions of a planned Casco Bay Model being co-developed with NERACOOS 
   that would be required to fully address those data needs,
   
*  Suggestions about monitoring or data collection that could improve
   information availability.

If a paragraph or live note included something relevant to one or more of
these categories, we summarized the related idea, and then assigned each
paragraph or comment to categories. In this way we "coded" each note or
comment (Twice! once for live notes and once for transcripts). Now we can 
look at what ideas were expressed most commonly during the workshops,
examine relationships between users and the types of information they want, 
and more.

Of course, not all comments include information related to each of the six 
types of information, so there is not a perfect one-to-one correspondence 
between categories.

The primary purpose of the code and data included here is to generate summary
graphics, spur conversation, and help generate insights that will be useful
as we figure out how to address community needs.

Quick document to test rendering to PDF documents.

```{r}
library(ggmosaic)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = fly) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(rude_to_recline), fill=do_you_recline)) +
  theme_mosaic()
```

## Resulting Error Message
```
output file: TEST-ggmosaic.knit.md

! LaTeX Error: Unicode character ^^[ (U+001B)
               not set up for use with LaTeX.

Error: LaTeX failed to compile TEST-ggmosaic.tex. See https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging for debugging tips. See TEST-ggmosaic.log for more info.
Execution halted
```

## Further Testing
The problem does not occur if I assign the plot to a variable, but it **does**
occur if I then save that plot with `ggsave()`, even without showing the plot.

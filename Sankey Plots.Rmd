# Introduction
CBEP recently received a grant from NSF's CIVIC Innovation Challenge to work on 
developing hydrodynamic models that address community needs in Portland Harbor.
As part of the project, CBEP hosted three community workshops in November of
2022.

Facilitators produced both "live" notes during the meeting -- visible to all on
a screen at the front of the meeting room -- and detailed meeting transcripts.
CBEP staff then reviewed those notes paragraph by paragraph, and coded each 
paragraph in terms of six characteristics:

*  Potential users and uses of hydrodynamic models,

*  Data or information needs identified by community members,

*  Implied extensions of the initial Casco Bay Model required to fully address
   those data needs, and
   
*  Ideas for improving communications of model results (e.g., communications 
   channels and user interface design),

*  Specifications for model performance or capabilities such as resolution,
   geographic coverage or ability to conduct simulations.

*  Suggestions about monitoring or data collection that could improve
   information availability.

If a paragraph or live note included something relevant to one or more of
these categories, we summarized the related idea, and then assigned each
paragraph or comment to categories. In this way we cn look at what ideas were 
expressed most commonly during the workshops.

Of course, not all paragraphs include information related to each of the five 
types of information, so there is not a perfect one-to-one correspondence 
between categories.

In this R Notebook, I explore these data principally by looking at 
cross-correlations among ideas in the different categories.

# Load Packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(networkD3)  #an alternative might be the riverplot package

theme_set(theme_classic())
```

# Create Figures Folder
```{r}
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

# Load Data
```{r}
the_data <- read_excel("Data_Export_Query.xlsx" ) %>%
  mutate(ID = as.integer(ID)) %>%
  rename_with(function(x) sub(" Category_Category", '_Category', x)) %>%
  rename_with(function(x) sub(" ", '_', x))
head(the_data)
```

Our coding was generated in a somewhat sloppy `Access` database, and because of
the way SQL works, it is easier to replace numerical values for some groups
here, in `R`, rather than before we exported the data from `Access`. I read in
the dictionaries here.

```{r}
timing_table <- read_excel("Timing Category.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text"))
data_types_table <- read_excel("Data Type.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text"))
```

##  Numerical Values to Strings
And finally I correct the data table to all text entries.
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(Data_Timing = timing_table$Timing[match(Data_Timing, 
                                                 timing_table$ID)],
         Extension_Timing = timing_table$Timing[match(Extension_Timing,
                                                      timing_table$ID)],
         Performance_Timing = timing_table$Timing[match(Performance_Timing,
                                                      timing_table$ID)]) %>%
  mutate(Monitoring_Data_Group = data_types_table$Group[match(Monitoring_Data_Group,
                                                    data_types_table$ID)],
         Performance_Type = data_types_table$Group[match(Performance_Type,
                                                    data_types_table$ID)])
```


#A Warning about Uniqueness
We have to be careful here, because each note or comment can be represented in 
this data table multiple times. Each paragraph in the meeting transcript might 
imply several different users, for example.  But if there are multiple users and
multiple data types, the records got duplicated (in part) in the SQL query.  So 
for any analysis, we need to test for uniqueness of the data. always

We actually have over 400 records, built out of just over 200 unique comments.

```{r}
cat("All rows in the data:\t\t")
nrow(the_data)

cat("Unique comments reviewed:\t")
the_data %>%
  select(ID) %>%
  unique() %>%
  nrow()
```

# Sankay Plot Methods

We need to create a network data set, which has to identify links between notes
by `Source`, `Target` and `Value`.  The `sankeyNetwork()` function from the 
`networkD3` package on which we rely wants the data in a very specific format. 

*  It wants to define NODES via a data frame of node labels (and, optionally,
   node groups that can be used to assign colors to nodes).

*  It wants to define links via a data frame containing NUMERIC (integer?)
   values identifying nodes. The data frame can also include data on link groups
   for assigning colors to links.

*  The integers defining each node must match the order of those
   nodes in the nodes data frame.  

## Data Wrangling
For clarity, I break the data wrangling up into discrete steps. That simplifies 
both explanation and checking intermediate results.  

First, we select the user and data information. 

We are headed for a display that shown User or Use groups on the left, and Data
groups on the right.  Both User and Data classifications included a category
called simply "Other", for comments that clearly articulated a data request that 
I could not figure out how to categorize.  

Sankey plots need not be unidirectional, so logically, nodes are neither
sources nor targets.  If I use the same name for both the "User Other" and the
"Data Other" categories, the package sees them as the same category, which has
unintended effects on plot geometry (since we can then have "Other" as either or
both a source or a target.

TO avoid that problem, we have to edit the category names so the two "Other"
categories don't look equivalent.

Finally, we convert the (string) data to factors, and sort them in decreasing 
order of frequency, which may help with later graphic design.

```{r}
tmp <- the_data %>%
  select(ID, User_Category, Data_Group) %>%
  filter(! is.na(User_Category)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(Data_Group)) %>%
  mutate(User_Category = if_else(User_Category == 'Other',
                                      'Other User', User_Category),
         Data_Group = if_else(Data_Group == 'Other',
                                      'Other Data',Data_Group)) %>%
  mutate(User_Category = if_else(User_Category == 'Water Quality',
                                      'Water Quality User', User_Category),
         Data_Group = if_else(Data_Group == 'Water Quality',
                                      'Water Quality Data',Data_Group)) %>%
  mutate(User_Category = fct_infreq(User_Category),
         Data_Group = fct_infreq(Data_Group)) %>%
  unique()
```

We next calculate the number of links between each pair of source and target
nodes.

```{r}
tmp2 <- tmp %>%
  group_by(User_Category, Data_Group) %>%
  summarize(weight = n(), 
            .groups = 'drop')
```


I add a `groups` variable, to allow me to control the color of the source and 
target nodes in the diagram.

```{r}
nodes <- tibble(node_name = c(unique(tmp2$User_Category),
                              unique(tmp2$Data_Group)),
                groups = c(rep("A", length(unique(tmp2$User_Category))),
                           rep("B", length(unique(c(tmp2$Data_Group))))))
```

Then we have to convert the character string values in our links data frame 
(`tmp2`) to zero-valued numerical IDs, as required by the `networkD3` package. 

`match()` here is a quick way of implicitly extracting the row number of a 
matching record from each vector (column) in the `tmp2` data frame.

```{r}
tmp3 <- tmp2 %>%
  mutate(link_group = User_Category,
         User_Category = match(User_Category, nodes$node_name) - 1,
         Data_Group = match(Data_Group, nodes$node_name) - 1)

```

## Initial Graphic
```{r}
plt <- sankeyNetwork(Links = tmp3,
             Source = "User_Category",
             Target = "Data_Group",
             Value = "weight",
             Nodes = nodes,
             NodeID = "node_name",
             NodeGroup = 'groups',
             height = 800,
             fontSize = 16,
             iterations = 0)
plt
```

## Custom Colors
It might be nice to color the nodes or links according to categories.
This is surprisingly difficult, because the package uses one color scale for 
both notes and links. 

I found it hard to figure out how colors were ordered, and then found it hard to
assemble the correct color specification as required for `network3D`.

I generate new node group names.  For the "Source" nodes, we use the name of the 
user category.  For the "Target" nodes, we use an arbitrary string, here `"B"`.

```{r}
users <- as.character(levels(tmp2$User_Category))
types <- as.character(levels(tmp2$Data_Group))

nodes <- tibble(node_name = c(users, types),
                groups = c(users,
                           rep("B", length(unique(c(tmp2$Data_Group))))))
```

We want the links to match the color of the source nodes, so we  specify
matching color group names for links based on the source (here, left hand) 
nodes.

```{r}
tmp3 <- tmp2 %>%
  mutate(link_group = as.character(User_Category),
         User_Category = match(User_Category, nodes$node_name) - 1,
         Data_Group = match(Data_Group, nodes$node_name) - 1)
```

Now I have to define my color palette.  This is more work than it should be
because you have to encapsulate a D3 graphics command in a string so that
the `sankeyNetwork()` function can pass it on to the underlying Java / D3
code.

The command requires you to define the names and the colors together as the 
domain and range of the palette.

I randomize color order to minimize conflict with adjacent nodes. I specify the
last color -- for the right hand nodes -- as a medium purple gray.

```{r}
domain = c(users, "B")
(grps <- length(domain))
range <- sample(hcl.colors(15, palette = "viridis"), grps - 1, replace = FALSE)
range <- c(range,"#9090c0")
range
```

In the next step I build a data frame containing the domain and range. It is 
probably not strictly necessary, but it did avoid some odd artifacts with 
escaped quotes.

```{r}
cols <- tibble(d = domain, r = range)
cols
```

The colors are assembles as a string, which takes some fussy work to do 
programmatically using `paste()`. Basically, I concatenate the text needed for
the D3 function call with the lists of domain and range I just built.

```{r}
the_colors <- paste0('d3.scaleOrdinal() .domain(["', 
                     paste(cols$d, collapse='", "'), 
                     '"]) .range(["',
                      paste(cols$r, collapse='", "'),
                     '"])')
cat(the_colors)
```

### Revised Graphic
```{r}
plt <- sankeyNetwork(Links = tmp3,
             Source = "User_Category",
             Target = "Data_Group",
             Value = "weight",
             LinkGroup = "link_group",
             NodeGroup = "groups",
             Nodes = nodes,
             NodeID = "node_name",
             colourScale = the_colors,
             nodeWidth = 20,
             nodePadding = 10,
             height = 700,
             fontSize = 16,
             fontFamily = 'Montserrat ExtraBold',
             iterations = 0)
plt
```


## Simplified Graphic
That graphic looks like a bowl of spaghetti.  Most connections represent only
one mention during the workshops.  Since the data is based on both the live
notes and the later transcript, one mention could show up either once or twice
in my classification of the notes.

So, what I want to do is simplify the data by hiding all those "once or twice"
links.  It turns out if you drop rare links, a few nodes are never linked, so
I want to drop them too.

```{r}
tmp4 <- tmp2 %>%
  filter(weight > 2) 
```

```{r}
types <- unique(as.character(tmp4$Data_Group))
users <- unique(as.character(tmp4$User_Category))

nodes <- tibble(node_name = c(users, types),
                groups = c(users,
                           rep("B", length(types))))
```

```{r}
tmp5 <- tmp4 %>%
  mutate(link_group = as.character(User_Category),
         User_Category = match(User_Category, nodes$node_name) - 1,
         Data_Group = match(Data_Group, nodes$node_name) - 1)
```

```{r}
plt <- sankeyNetwork(Links = tmp5,
             Source = "User_Category",
             Target = "Data_Group",
             Value = "weight",
             LinkGroup = "link_group",
             NodeGroup = "groups",
             Nodes = nodes,
             NodeID = "node_name",
             colourScale = the_colors,
             nodeWidth = 20,
             nodePadding = 10,
             height = 700,
             fontSize = 16,
             fontFamily = 'Montserrat ExtraBold',
             iterations = 0)
plt
```

# Functions for Generating the Graphics
I develop three functions to encapsulate all of that logic.  All three are local
utility functions, so I eschew error checking.  The three functions are:

1.  A function to assemble the `D3` color function call

2. A function to convert our source data frames, with a column of source and 
target names, into the format required by `sankeyNetwork()`.

3.  A function that actually generates the Sankey Plot (and calls the other two 
functions).

## Define Color String
This function could be generalized to allow automated dropping of weak links.

```{r}
d3_colors <- function(left_names, right_name, final_color = NULL) {
  #left_names is a vector of string node labels used for the source nodes.
  #right.name is the name for the (single) target node group.
  #final_color is a string defining a color for the right (target) nodes.
  
  domain = c(left_names, right_name)
  grps <- length(left_names) + 1
  #browser()
  if(! is.null(final_color)) {
    range <- sample(hcl.colors(grps-1, palette = "viridis"), grps - 1, 
                    replace = FALSE)
    range <- c(range,final_color)
  }
  else
    #print(grps)
    range <- sample(hcl.colors(grps, palette = "viridis"), grps, 
                    replace = FALSE)
  cols <- tibble(d = domain, r = range)
  the_colors <- paste0('d3.scaleOrdinal() .domain(["', 
                       paste(cols$d, collapse='", "'), 
                       '"]) .range(["',
                       paste(cols$r, collapse='", "'),
                       '"])')
  return(the_colors)
}
```

```{r}
d3_colors(c("cat", "dog", "squirrel"), "foods", "#ffffff")
```

## Assemble the Nodes and Links Data Frames
We have to be able to filter the data to remove rare connections.  This function 
builds and rebuilds the data set.
I'm going to forego error checking here and keep this as simple as possible...
```{r}
assemble_frames <- function(.dat, .left, .right, 
                            right_name = 'right') {
  # .data is the RAW data with left-right string pairs (in two variables) that
  #  show a link between source (.left) and target (.right).
  
  grouped <- .dat %>%
    group_by({{ .left}}, {{.right}}) %>%
    summarize(weight = n(), 
              .groups = 'drop')
  
  # browser()
  # there is probably a more efficient way to extract labels, that avoids
  # building an unnecessary data frame, but this works, and lets me use 
  # tidyverse indirection....
  
  labs <- grouped %>%
    mutate(left = factor({{ .left}}),
           right = factor({{.right}}))
  
  #I can ignore order here because the Sankey function does....
  # By calling `factor()` here, it re-levels and drops empty categories.
  left = levels(factor(labs$left))
  right = levels(factor(labs$right))
  rm(labs)
  
  nodes <- tibble(node_name = c(left, right),
                  groups = c(left,
                             rep(right_name, length(right))))
  links <- grouped %>%
    mutate(link_group = as.character({{.left}}),
           "{{.left}}" := match({{.left}}, nodes$node_name) - 1,
           "{{.right}}":= match({{.right}}, nodes$node_name) - 1)
  
  return(list(Nodes = as.data.frame(nodes), Links = as.data.frame(links)))
}
```

```{r}
test <- tmp %>%
  assemble_frames(User_Category, Data_Group, 'bicycle')
```

```{r}
test$Nodes[10:20,]
```

```{r}
head(test$Links,5)
```

## Draw Sankey Plot
This encapsulates data frame preparation, color assignment and my selected plot
characteristics.

```{r}
my_sankey <- function(.dat, .left, .right,
                      final_color = NULL, drop_below = NULL) {

  right_name <- 'right'
  left_str <- as.character(ensym(.left))
  right_str <- as.character(ensym(.right))
  
  if (! is.null(drop_below)) {
    .dat <- .dat %>%
      group_by({{.left}}, {{.right}}) %>%
      mutate(links = n()) %>%
      filter(links >= drop_below)%>%
      select(-links)
  }
  
  my_data <- assemble_frames(.dat, {{.left}}, {{.right}},
                             right_name = right_name)
  
  left <- my_data$Links %>%
    mutate(left = as.character(link_group)) %>%
    pull(left)
  left <- unique(as.character(left))

  the_colors <- d3_colors(left, right_name = right_name, 
                          final_color = final_color)
  #browser()
  the_graphic <- sankeyNetwork(Links = my_data$Links,
             Source = left_str,
             Target = right_str,
             Value = "weight",
             LinkGroup = "link_group",
             NodeGroup = "groups",
             Nodes = my_data$Nodes,
             NodeID = "node_name",
             colourScale = the_colors,
             nodeWidth = 20,
             nodePadding = 10,
             height = 700,
             fontSize = 28,
             fontFamily = 'Montserrat ExtraBold',
             iterations = 0)
  
 return(the_graphic)
}
```

                 'figures/users and interfaces.png')
```

## Simplified Plot
```{r}
plt <- tmp %>%
  my_sankey(User_Category, Interface_Category, final_color ="#9090a0", 
            drop_below = 3)

plt
```

```{r}
saveNetwork(plt, file = 'figures/users and interfaces simple.html', 
            selfcontained = TRUE)
webshot::webshot('figures/users and interfaces simple.html', 
                 'figures/users and interfaces simple.png')
```

Not very useful....

# From Data Requests to Time Domain
## Full Data
Note that data preparation requires avoiding category conflicts between the 
"source" and "target" note lists here. Specifically, "Unclear" appears in both
lists here.  We need to rename or delete at least one of them.  We chose to 
delete the "Unclear" categories entirely, since they are  not informative in 
this context.

```{r}
unique(the_data$Data_Group)
cat("\n")
unique(the_data$Data_Timing)
```

```{r}
tmp <- the_data %>%
  select(ID, Data_Group, Data_Timing) %>%
  filter(Data_Timing != "Unclear",
         Data_Group != "Unclear") %>%
  filter(! is.na(Data_Group),
         ! is.na(Data_Timing)) %>%
  mutate(Data_Timing = fct_infreq(Data_Timing),
         Data_Group = fct_infreq(Data_Group)) %>%
  unique()
```

```{r}
plt <- tmp %>%
  my_sankey(Data_Group, Data_Timing, final_color ="#9090a0")

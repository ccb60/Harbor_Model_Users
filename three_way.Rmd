# Introduction
CBEP recently received a grant from NSF's CIVIC Innovation Challenge to work on 
developing hydrodynamic models that address community needs in Portland Harbor.
As part of the project, CBEP hosted three community workshops in November of
2022.

Facilitators produced both "live" notes during the meeting -- visible to all on
a screen at the front of the meeting room -- and detailed meeting transcripts.
CBEP staff then reviewed those notes paragraph by paragraph, and coded each 
paragraph in terms of six characteristics:

*  Potential users and uses of hydrodynamic models,

*  Data or information needs identified by community members,

*  Implied extensions of the initial Casco Bay Model required to fully address
   those data needs, and
   
*  Ideas for improving communications of model results (e.g., communications 
   channels and user interface design),

*  Specifications for model performance or capabilities such as resolution,
   geographic coverage or ability to conduct simulations.

*  Suggestions about monitoring or data collection that could improve
   information availability.

If a paragraph or live note included something relevant to one or more of
these categories, we summarized the related idea, and then assigned each
paragraph or comment to categories. In this way we cn look at what ideas were 
expressed most commonly during the workshops.

Of course, not all paragraphs include information related to each of the five 
types of information, so there is not a perfect one-to-one correspondence 
between categories.

In this R Notebook, I explore these data by looking at a three-way relations
between users, time domains, and information needs.  one goal is to identify 
nodes of shared importance to different users that might help define 

# Load Packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(networkD3)  #an alternative might be the riverplot package

theme_set(theme_classic())
```

# Create Figures Folder
```{r}
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

# Load Data
```{r}
the_data <- read_excel("Data_Export_Query.xlsx" ) %>%
  mutate(ID = as.integer(ID)) %>%
  rename_with(function(x) sub(" Category_Category", '_Category', x)) %>%
  rename_with(function(x) sub(" ", '_', x))
head(the_data)
```

Our coding was generated in a somewhat sloppy `Access` database, and because of
the way SQL works, it is easier to replace numerical values for some groups
here, in `R`, rather than before we exported the data from `Access`. I read in
the dictionaries here.

```{r}
timing_table <- read_excel("Timing Category.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text"))
data_types_table <- read_excel("Data Type.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text"))
```

##  Numerical Values to Strings
And finally I correct the data table to all text entries.
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(Data_Timing = timing_table$Timing[match(Data_Timing, 
                                                 timing_table$ID)],
         Extension_Timing = timing_table$Timing[match(Extension_Timing,
                                                      timing_table$ID)],
         Performance_Timing = timing_table$Timing[match(Performance_Timing,
                                                      timing_table$ID)]) %>%
  mutate(Monitoring_Data_Group = data_types_table$Group[match(Monitoring_Data_Group,
                                                    data_types_table$ID)],
         Performance_Type = data_types_table$Group[match(Performance_Type,
                                                    data_types_table$ID)])
```


#A Warning about Uniqueness
We have to be careful here, because each note or comment can be represented in 
this data table multiple times. Each paragraph in the meeting transcript might 
imply several different users, for example.  But if there are multiple users and
multiple data types, the records got duplicated (in part) in the SQL query.  So 
for any analysis, we need to test for uniqueness of the data. always

We actually have over 400 records, built out of just over 200 unique comments.

```{r}
cat("All rows in the data:\t\t")
nrow(the_data)

cat("Unique comments reviewed:\t")
the_data %>%
  select(ID) %>%
  unique() %>%
  nrow()
```

# Sankay Plot Methods

We need to create a network data set, which has to identify links between notes
by `Source`, `Target` and `Value`.  The `sankeyNetwork()` function from the 
`networkD3` package on which we rely wants the data in a very specific format. 

*  It wants to define NODES via a data frame of node labels (and, optionally,
   node groups that can be used to assign colors to nodes).

*  It wants to define links via a data frame containing NUMERIC (integer?)
   values identifying nodes. The data frame can also include data on link groups
   for assigning colors to links.

*  The integers defining each node must match the order of those
   nodes in the nodes data frame.  

## Data Wrangling
For clarity, I break the data wrangling up into discrete steps. That simplifies 
both explanation and checking intermediate results.  

First, we select the user,timing, and data information. 

We are headed for a display that shown User or Use groups on the left, timing 
in hte middle, and Data groups on the right.  Both User and Data classifications 
included a category called simply "Other", for comments that clearly articulated 
a data request that  I could not figure out how to categorize.  

Sankey plots need not be unidirectional, so logically, nodes are neither
sources nor targets.  If I use the same name for both the "User Other" and the
"Data Other" categories, the package sees them as the same category, which has
unintended effects on plot geometry (since we can then have "Other" as either or
both a source or a target.

To avoid that problem, we have to edit the category names so the two "Other"
categories don't look equivalent.

Finally, we convert the (string) data to factors, and sort them in decreasing 
order of frequency, which may help with later graphic design.

```{r}
reduced_data <- the_data %>%
  select(ID, User_Category, Data_Timing, Data_Group) %>%
  filter(! is.na(User_Category)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(Data_Group)) %>%
  mutate(User_Category = if_else(User_Category == 'Other',
                                      'Other User', User_Category),
         Data_Timing = if_else(Data_Timing == 'Unclear', 
                               "Unspecified", Data_Timing),
         Data_Group = if_else(Data_Group == 'Other',
                                      'Other Data',Data_Group)) %>%
  mutate(User_Category = if_else(User_Category == 'Water Quality',
                                      'Water Quality User', User_Category),
         Data_Group = if_else(Data_Group == 'Water Quality',
                                      'Water Quality Data',Data_Group)) %>%
  mutate(User_Category = fct_infreq(User_Category),
         Data_Group = fct_infreq(Data_Group)) %>%
  unique()
```

We next calculate the number of links between each pair of source and target
nodes.

```{r}
user_to_timing_link_num <- reduced_data %>%
  group_by(User_Category, Data_Timing) %>%
  summarize(weight = n(), 
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  rename(from = User_Category,
         to = Data_Timing)

timing_to_Data_link_num <- reduced_data %>%
  group_by(Data_Timing, Data_Group) %>%
  summarize(weight = n(), 
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  rename(from = Data_Timing,
         to = Data_Group )

my_links <- bind_rows(user_to_timing_link_num, timing_to_Data_link_num)
```

I create a data frame of nodes, that includes  a `groups` variable, to allow me 
to control the color of the nodes in the diagram.

```{r}
nodes <- tibble(node_name = c(unique(as.character(user_to_timing_link_num$from)),
                              unique(as.character(user_to_timing_link_num$to)),
                              unique(as.character(timing_to_Data_link_num$to))
                              ),
                groups = c(rep("A", length(unique(user_to_timing_link_num$from))),
                           rep("B", length(unique(user_to_timing_link_num$to))),
                           rep("C", length(unique(c(timing_to_Data_link_num$to))))))
```

Then we have to convert the character string values in our links data frame 
(`my_links`) to zero-valued numerical IDs, as required by the `networkD3` 
package. 

`match()` here is a quick way of implicitly extracting the row number of a 
matching record from each vector (column) in the `tmp2` data frame.

```{r}
the_links <- my_links %>%
  mutate(link_group = if_else(to %in% user_to_timing_link_num$to,
                              to, from),
         from = match(from, nodes$node_name) - 1,
         to = match(to, nodes$node_name) - 1)

```

## Initial Graphic
```{r}
plt <- sankeyNetwork(Links = the_links,
             Source = "from",
             Target = "to",
             Value = "weight",
             Nodes = nodes,
             NodeID = "node_name",
             NodeGroup = 'groups',
             height = 800,
             fontSize = 12,
             iterations = 0)
plt
```

## Custom Colors
It might be nice to color the nodes or links according to categories.
This is surprisingly difficult, because the package uses one color scale for 
both notes and links. 

I found it hard to figure out how colors were ordered, and then found it hard to
assemble the correct color specification as required for `network3D`.

I generate new node group names.  For the "Source" nodes, we use the name of the 
user category.  For the "Target" nodes, we use an arbitrary string, here `"B"`.

```{r}
nodes <- tibble(node_name = c(unique(as.character(user_to_timing_link_num$from)),
                              unique(as.character(user_to_timing_link_num$to)),
                              unique(as.character(timing_to_Data_link_num$to))
                              ),
                groups = c(rep("A", length(unique(user_to_timing_link_num$from))),
                           rep("B", length(unique(user_to_timing_link_num$to))),
                           rep("C", length(unique(c(timing_to_Data_link_num$to))))))
```


```{r}
users <- unique(as.character(user_to_timing_link_num$from))
timing <- unique(as.character(user_to_timing_link_num$to))
types <- unique(as.character(timing_to_Data_link_num$to))

nodes <- tibble(node_name = c(users, timing, types),
                groups = c(users,
                           rep("None", length(timing)),
                           types))
```


We want the links to match the color of the source nodes, so we  specify
matching color group names for links based on the source (here, left hand) 
nodes.

```{r}
the_links <- my_links %>%
  mutate(link_group = if_else(to %in% timing_to_Data_link_num$to,
                              to, from),
         from = match(from, nodes$node_name) - 1,
         to = match(to, nodes$node_name) - 1)

```


Now I have to define my color palette.  This is more work than it should be
because you have to encapsulate a D3 graphics command in a string so that
the `sankeyNetwork()` function can pass it on to the underlying Java / D3
code.

I wrote a function to handle the details.

### Function to Define Color String

```{r}
d3_colors <- function(link_names) {
  #left_names is a vector of string node labels used for the source nodes.
  #right.name is the name for the (single) target node group.
  #final_color is a string defining a color for the right (target) nodes.
  
  grps <- length(link_names)
  
  range <- sample(hcl.colors(grps, palette = "viridis"), grps, 
                    replace = FALSE)
  cols <- tibble(d = link_names, r = range)
  the_colors <- paste0('d3.scaleOrdinal() .domain(["', 
                       paste(cols$d, collapse='", "'), 
                       '"]) .range(["',
                       paste(cols$r, collapse='", "'),
                       '"])')
  return(the_colors)
}
```

```{r}
d3_colors(c("cat", "dog", "squirrel"))
```

### Revised Graphic
```{r}
the_colors <- d3_colors(nodes$node_name)
```


```{r}
plt <- sankeyNetwork(Links = the_links,
             Source = "from",
             Target = "to",
             Value = "weight",
             LinkGroup = "link_group",
             NodeGroup = "groups",
             Nodes = nodes,
             NodeID = "node_name",
             colourScale = the_colors,
             nodeWidth = 5,
             nodePadding = 10,
             height = 700,
             fontSize = 12,
             fontFamily = 'Montserrat ExtraBold',
             iterations = 0)
plt
```


## Simplified Graphic
```{r}
threshold <- 4

user_to_timing_link_num <- reduced_data %>%
  group_by(User_Category, Data_Timing) %>%
  summarize(weight = n(), 
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  rename(from = User_Category,
         to = Data_Timing) %>%
  filter(weight >= threshold) %>%
  filer()

timing_to_Data_link_num <- reduced_data %>%
  group_by(Data_Timing, Data_Group) %>%
  summarize(weight = n(), 
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  rename(from = Data_Timing,
         to = Data_Group ) %>%
  filter(weight >= threshold)

my_links <- bind_rows(user_to_timing_link_num, timing_to_Data_link_num)
```

```{r}
nodes <- tibble(node_name = c(unique(as.character(user_to_timing_link_num$from)),
                              unique(as.character(user_to_timing_link_num$to)),
                              unique(as.character(timing_to_Data_link_num$to))
                              ),
                groups = c(rep("A", length(unique(user_to_timing_link_num$from))),
                           rep("B", length(unique(user_to_timing_link_num$to))),
                           rep("C", length(unique(c(timing_to_Data_link_num$to))))))
```

```{r}
users <- unique(as.character(user_to_timing_link_num$from))
timing <- unique(as.character(user_to_timing_link_num$to))
types <- unique(as.character(timing_to_Data_link_num$to))

nodes <- tibble(node_name = c(users, timing, types),
                groups = c(users,
                           rep("None", length(timing)),
                           types))
```


```{r}
the_links <- my_links %>%
  mutate(link_group = if_else(to %in% timing_to_Data_link_num$to,
                              to, from),
         from = match(from, nodes$node_name) - 1,
         to = match(to, nodes$node_name) - 1)
```

```{r}
the_colors <- d3_colors(nodes$node_name)
```


```{r}
plt <- sankeyNetwork(Links = the_links,
             Source = "from",
             Target = "to",
             Value = "weight",
             LinkGroup = "link_group",
             NodeGroup = "groups",
             Nodes = nodes,
             NodeID = "node_name",
             colourScale = the_colors,
             nodeWidth = 5,
             nodePadding = 10,
             height = 700,
             fontSize = 12,
             fontFamily = 'Montserrat ExtraBold',
             iterations = 0)
plt
```


That did not quite work because of tha rarity of requests for the recent past and for 
unspecified timing.

```{r}
saveNetwork(plt, file = 'figures/threeway.html', 
            selfcontained = TRUE)
webshot::webshot('figures/treeway.html', 
                 'figures/treeway.png')
```
